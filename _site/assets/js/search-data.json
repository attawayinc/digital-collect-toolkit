    "content": "About the Toolkit As the events of Friday August 11th and Saturday August 12th, 2017 in Charlottesville unfolded, Library staff at the University of Virginia actively watched the news and began capturing information from websites and social media. When Library administration met the following Tuesday morning, we were asked if we could create a site that allowed community members to contribute their photos and videos online. While the UVA Library had some experience documenting and collecting digital content after a major news event, this was the first time we attempted to create a collecting site so quickly after the events occurred. We consulted with other institutions who had created similar sites, and built on their previous work. We set up workflows to ensure that no malware or viruses were upload in the process. It took use a little over three weeks to launch our online collecting tool, far longer than we had initially hoped. The lessons learned from the site launch of the University of Virginia Library’s Digital Collecting site, “Unite the Right” Rally and Community Response has led to further workflow and tool development to help future collecting efforts for ourselves and others. This Toolkit is a result of these efforts, and is intended to help others quickly launch similar sites in times of crisis. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us at digital_collecting@virginia.edu.",

    "content": "Collecting Materials We’ve included detailed documentation on how our Digital Collecting site uses the Contribution plugin to collect stories, images, videos, and links from the public. Please read through the Installation &amp; Configuration Guide for full set-up instructions before getting started. Contribution Types Contribution Types After installing the plugin, find the settings for Contribution by clicking on the “Contributed Items” tab on the left-hand navigation panel of the Omeka admin dashboard. Here you will see four tabs: Getting Started, Contribution Types, Submission Settings, and Contributions. Select “Contribution Types” to manage the types of items you’d like users to share through the form: See in the above image that we have included four contribution types for our site: Story, Photograph, Link, and Video. The type’s Name is the label that will appear in your site’s Contribution Form: The Item Type is the type of object associated with your Contribution Type, and is selected when you add a new contribution type to your form (see the green button ‘Add a Type’ on the right). These are not visible to the public, but can help in defining search fields. Omeka comes with pre-defined item types, found by clicking on the “Item Types” tab on the left-hand navigation panel of the Omeka admin dashboard. You can edit and add to this list if needed (see the related Omeka Documentation). Our site uses the pre-defined types: Text, Still Image, Hyperlink, and Moving Image.",
