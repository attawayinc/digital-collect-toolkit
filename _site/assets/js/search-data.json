    "content": "About the Toolkit As the events of Friday August 11th and Saturday August 12th, 2017 in Charlottesville unfolded, Library staff at the University of Virginia actively watched the news and began capturing information from websites and social media. When Library administration met the following Tuesday morning, we were asked if we could create a site that allowed community members to contribute their photos and videos online. While the UVA Library had some experience documenting and collecting digital content after a major news event, this was the first time we attempted to create a collecting site so quickly after the events occurred. We consulted with other institutions who had created similar sites, and built on their previous work. We set up workflows to ensure that no malware or viruses were upload in the process. It took use a little over three weeks to launch our online collecting tool, far longer than we had initially hoped. The lessons learned from the site launch of the University of Virginia Library’s Digital Collecting site, “Unite the Right” Rally and Community Response has led to further workflow and tool development to help future collecting efforts for ourselves and others. This Toolkit is a result of these efforts, and is intended to help others quickly launch similar sites in times of crisis. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us at digital_collecting@virginia.edu.",

Twarc requires familiarity with using the command line to navigate your file system, configure Twarc, and run queries. For introductory lessons on using the command line, see these tutorials for Mac and Windows users from the UNLV Libraries, here. The Command Line tutorial is part of UNLV Libraries’ Twitter Data Tutorial Series, which features ten tutorials that take you step-by-step through the design, collection, and documentation process of curating a collection of Twitter data, as well as tutorials on tools for data analysis. This series is focused on using Twarc and offers another resource, in addition to this toolkit. Download and install the latest version of Python, here. Twarc works with with either version 2 or 3. If you are a Mac user, you may already have Python installed. To check, open your terminal and run the command: python -V or python --version Twarc for Mac OS For Windows users, click here Installing Twarc Open the Terminal application (located in the applications folder) Pip install Twarc by entering the following command: pip install twarc Note: Pip is already installed if you are using Python 2 ≥ 2.7.9 or Python 3 ≥ 3.4 macOS users also have the option of installing Twarc via homebrew using the command: brew install twarc Configuring Twarc To get started, you will need to tell Twarc about your application API keys and grant access to one or more Twitter accounts. Follow these directions to configure Twarc: Enter the following command in Terminal: twarc configure Twarc will ask you to enter several keys. You should have these keys ready to go after registering an application. Type or copy/paste your consumer key, then press ‘enter’. Next, Twarc will ask for your consumer secret.

Mellon Foundation. We use the tools developed by DocNow for collecting twitter data because of their strong commitment to prioritizing ethical practices in collection, use, and preservation of social media content. The following documentation is intended to assist in setting up Twarc, a DocNow tool for archiving twitter data. For more information on Twarc or other DocNow tools, please visit their site. Twarc for Twitter Data Collection Twarc is a command line tool that downloads tweets using Twitter’s API. API’s, or application programming interfaces, are simply ways that different organizations, whether it is Twitter or the Census bureau, provide more direct access to data. API’s also oftentimes provide limits to how much data you can gather. Twitter’s API limit for downloading tweets from a user account as of writing this is 3200 tweets. Twarc will handle Twitter API’s rate limits for you. The following pages provide instructions on installing and using Twarc. Parts of this guide are subject to change with updates to Twitter’s developers site, so please use this guide as a general guideline. For troubleshooting with Twarc, please contact the developers of DocNow, and join in conversation with the DocNow community of scholars, students, and archivists. To get started you will need a twitter account to register a twitter application. Twarc also requires Python.",

If the following steps and screenshots do not match precisely, please use this as a general guide, or contact DocNow. If you do not have a twitter account, create one at twitter.com. A twitter account is required for access to twitter data. Log into you twitter account to set-up and and authorize a twitter application. A Twitter application will let you download twitter data using Python. Create an app at developer.twitter.com/en/apps Following the above link should bring you to this page: Click on ‘Create an App’ You may be prompted to create a Twitter developer account. Select ‘Apply’ and continue: Setting up a Twitter Developer Account If you already have a developer accout set up, skip to Creating a Twitter App. Select a user profile to associate with the developer account, and select ‘Continue’. In the ‘Account details’ section, select your request for access for either your organization or for personal use. Note: Selecting “for my own personal use” offers the simplest and quickest method of setting up a developer account. If you are following this guide for research or teaching purposes, an individual, personal account is suggested. Twitter users can only have a single developement account, and cannot change account types. An ‘Organization’ account differs in that it allows for additional twitter users to share access on a single dev account, however, this is mainly geared toward commercial use and is intended for development for premium APIs ($), and is outside the scope of this guide. For more, see Twitter’s FAQ. If you select “for my own personal use,” you will be prompted to fill in an Account Name and to select your Primary Country of Operation. Both are required. If you select “for my organization,” you are required to fill out the following: Organization Name (the name of your account) Legal Entity Name (may be the same as Organization Name) Organization Twitter @username Organization Primary Country of Operation Customer Location (select ‘Not Applicable(we do not have customers)’) Categorize your Organization (select ‘Academic’) Industries served (select Academic) In the next section on ‘Use Case Details’, answer several questions about your project and why you are building an app to gather twitter data. You can provide answers similar to the ones below if relevant to your project. Most importantly note that this is for academic purposes and that you will not be Tweeting, Retweeting, or liking content. If your project does involve analysis of twitter content, an answer for question #2 might look something like “Yes, my project will analyze tweets using text analysis, word clouds, word frequency, and word association using R.” Read and Accept the Twitter Terms of Service. Verify your Twitter Developement Account via the email associated with your Twitter account. Creating a Twitter App Once you have your Twitter Developer Account set up, you can register an application at developer.twitter.com/en/apps. Click ‘Create an App’ to begin: Fill out the required parts of the form for App Details. For the Website URL, you can simply put the URL for your twitter account, or any website you are affiliated with: Click ‘Create’. A pop-up may appear for reviewing the Twitter Developer Terms, click ‘Create’ to continue. You now have a registered Twitter app! You can edit any of these fields later from your Developer Account Apps page. Accessing Keys and Tokens From your Developer Account Apps page, find your app and click ‘Details’. Select the option for ‘Keys and Tokens’. On this page you will find your Consumer API keys. Under ‘Access token &amp; access token secret’, click ‘create’ to generate. Note down for use with Twarc these four alphanumeric values: Consumer API key Consumer API secret Access token Access token secret",
