    "content": "About the Toolkit As the events of Friday August 11th and Saturday August 12th, 2017 in Charlottesville unfolded, Library staff at the University of Virginia actively watched the news and began capturing information from websites and social media. When Library administration met the following Tuesday morning, we were asked if we could create a site that allowed community members to contribute their photos and videos online. While the UVA Library had some experience documenting and collecting digital content after a major news event, this was the first time we attempted to create a collecting site so quickly after the events occurred. We consulted with other institutions who had created similar sites, and built on their previous work. We set up workflows to ensure that no malware or viruses were upload in the process. It took use a little over three weeks to launch our online collecting tool, far longer than we had initially hoped. The lessons learned from the site launch of the University of Virginia Library’s Digital Collecting site, “Unite the Right” Rally and Community Response has led to further workflow and tool development to help future collecting efforts for ourselves and others. This Toolkit is a result of these efforts, and is intended to help others quickly launch similar sites in times of crisis. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us at digital_collecting@virginia.edu.",

    "content": "Collecting Materials We’ve included detailed documentation on how our Digital Collecting site uses the Contribution plugin to collect stories, images, videos, and links from the public. Please read through the Installation &amp; Configuration Guide for full set-up instructions before getting started. Creating Contribution Types Contributor Anonymity Settings Contribution Terms of Service Creating Contribution Types After installing the plugin, find the settings for Contribution by clicking on the “Contributed Items” tab on the left-hand navigation panel of the Omeka admin dashboard. Here you will see four tabs: Getting Started, Contribution Types, Submission Settings, and Contributions. Select “Contribution Types” to manage the types of items you’d like users to share through the form: See in the above image that we have included four contribution types for our site: Story, Photograph, Link, and Video. The type’s Name is the label that will appear in your site’s Contribution Form: The Item Type is the type of object associated with your Contribution Type, and is selected when you add a new contribution type to your form (see the green button ‘Add a Type’ on the right). These are not visible to the public, but can help in defining search fields. Omeka comes with pre-defined item types, found by clicking on the “Item Types” tab on the left-hand navigation panel of the Omeka admin dashboard. You can edit and add to this list if needed (see the related Omeka Documentation). Our site uses the pre-defined types: Text, Still Image, Hyperlink, and Moving Image. Contributor Anonymity Settings Under the tab for “Submission Settings” you can set options for contributor anonymity. Our site allows both Non-Registered Contributions and Anonymous Contributions: It is important to make clear in your Terms of Service that user anonymity is conditional, and it is likely that all submissions and associated data may be provided to federal, state, or local law enforcement or other government agencies pursuant to a lawful subpoena or court order. See our Terms of Service section for more details. For further documentation on Contributution Submission Settings and Contributor anonymity settings, see the related Omeka Documentation. Contribution Terms of Service We offer our Contribution Terms of Service for others as a model. Our terms were written in collaboration with the University of Virgina Library’s Legal Issues Librarian. You are welcome to use our text, although we recommend reviewing with relevant parties for your own collecting site. Contribution Terms of Service: You are being asked to contribute your recollections, photographic images, video, and/or other media to the University of Virginia (UVA), which is developing a permanent digital record of the events surrounding the Unite the Right rally and counter protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. You represent and warrant that the material you submit was created by you and was not copied from or based, in whole or in part, upon any other photographic, literary, or other material. Your participation in this project will allow the general public, as well as future University students and historians, to gain a greater understanding of these events and the response to them. You must be 18 years of age or older to submit material to us. Your submission of material constitutes your permission for, and consent to, its dissemination and use in connection with the research and teaching mission of the University of Virginia in all media in perpetuity. If you indicate on the form that your submission is “public,” your material may be published on the web (with or without your name, depending on what you have indicated) as part of the Library’s digital collections or exhibits. Otherwise, your response will only be available to Library-approved researchers. Submitted material must not violate any confidentiality, privacy, security or other laws. Please be aware that all submissions and any information associated with the submissions (email address, descriptive information, etc.) may be provided to federal, state, or local law enforcement or other government agencies pursuant to a lawful subpoena or court order. We reserve the right to discard or mark private any submission that UVA Library staff identify as offensive or irrelevant, or for any other reason within their professional judgment. In additon, our Digital Collecting site’s Terms of Service includes a Summary of Terms to help contributors quickly read and understand the main points of the full terms, in simpler language. It is important to note that this summary does not replace the full terms, and submissions are governed by the full terms of use. Summary of Terms* You must be at least 18 years old. Submitted material must be owned and/or created by you. You have the option of making your contribution public or private. If public, your content may be published as part of the Library’s digital collections (with or without your name displayed, depending on what you have indicated). All submissions will be available to Library-approved researchers and can be used by the Library from now on in support of its teaching and research mission. Your submission must not violate any laws. If we receive a lawful subpoena or court order, we may be required to turn over any submissions and related information (email address, descriptive information, etc.). *This summary is to help you read and understand the terms, but does not replace them. Your submission is governed by the full terms of use.",

    "content": "Tools for Archiving Social Media This guide presents methods of collecting twitter data using tools built by DocNow, a collaborative effort between Shift Design, Inc., the University of Maryland, and the University of Virginia, with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. We use the tools developed by DocNow for collecting twitter data because of their strong commitment to prioritizing ethical practices in collection, use, and preservation of social media content. The following documentation is intended to assist in setting up Twarc, a DocNow tool for archiving twitter data. For more information on Twarc or other DocNow tools, please visit their site. Twarc for Twitter Data Collection Twarc is a command line tool that downloads tweets using Twitter’s API. API’s, or application programming interfaces, are simply ways that different organizations, whether it is Twitter or the Census bureau, provide more direct access to data. API’s also oftentimes provide limits to how much data you can gather. Twitter’s API limit for downloading tweets from a user account as of writing this is 3200 tweets. Twarc will handle Twitter API’s rate limits for you. The following pages provide instructions on installing and using Twarc. Parts of this guide are subject to change with updates to Twitter’s developers site, so please use this guide as a general guideline. For troubleshooting with Twarc, please contact the developers of DocNow, and join their community of scholars, students, and archivists. To get started you will need a twitter account to register a twitter application. Twarc also requires Python.",
