<h1 id="welcome-to-the-digital-collecting-toolkit">Welcome to the Digital Collecting Toolkit!</h1>

<h2 id="what-is-this-toolkit">What is this Toolkit?</h2>

<p>This toolkit is designed to provide resources and instruction on
implementing digital collecting strategies during and after rapidly
evolving social events and/or community crises (like campus
controversies, natural disasters and public emergencies). Photos,
videos, and social media content are major components of these community
experiences, and the tools offered here can help organizations,
institutions and communities quickly implement an effective digital
collecting initiative.</p>

<p>This toolkit was created through a collaborative process by a team at
the <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia Library</a>,
with funding from the <a href="https://www.lyrasis.org">LYRASIS Catalyst Fund</a>.
In the immediate aftermath of the events of August 11th and 12th in
Charlottesville, VA, UVa Library staff took on the task of quickly
launching an online collecting tool and capturing related social media
content. While the UVA Library had some experience documenting and
collecting digital content after a major news event, this was the first
time we attempted to create a collecting site so quickly after the
events occurred. The lessons learned from the site launch of the
University of Virginia Library’s Digital Collecting site, <a href="http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/rally/"><em>“Unite the
Right” Rally and Community
Response</em></a> has led to
further workflow and tool development to help future collecting efforts
for ourselves and others.</p>

<p>This Toolkit is a result of these efforts, and is intended to help
others quickly launch similar sites in times of crisis.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h2>

<p>Our team includes University preservation librarians, digital
preservation specialists, archivists, digital content developers, and IT
specialists. We developed this toolkit for use by a wide range of
cultural institutions and communities with an interest in quickly
setting up a digital collection site. Members of University libraries,
other educational institutions, and community organizations using this
toolkit will need to have some level of access to the tools provided
here to implement a digital collection strategy. This could include
access to web hosting, server space, and an <a href="https://omeka.org/">Omeka</a>
installation. However, we have included a range of potential options for
these requirements in this toolkit.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ethical-considerations">Ethical Considerations</h2>

<p>Implementing and maintaining a digital collection site requires ethical,
community-centric practices. We’ve compiled some sources that explore
these considerations, and strongly encourage anyone developing an
archive from community contributions and/or social media content to read
further:</p>

<h2 id="funding-opportunities">Funding Opportunities</h2>

<p>This project was made possible in part by a 2018 award from the
<a href="https://www.lyrasis.org/Leadership/Pages/Catalyst-Fund.aspx">Catalyst Fund at
Lyrasis</a>.
It may be worth exploring grant programs that can help support your
digital collections.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.docnow.io/">Documenting the Now</a> has an annual call for
applicants for Community-Based Digital Archives Workshops for Activists.
Their workshops focus on helping activists to develop the skills and to
use available tools to collect, preserve, and share their web, social
media and other types of digital content in their own digital archive.</p>

<h2 id="technical-considerations">Technical Considerations</h2>

<h3 id="omeka-for-digital-collections">Omeka for Digital Collections</h3>

<p>Omeka offers two platforms - Omeka Classic and Omeka S - for publishing
and managing your digital collections. Our digital collecting site runs
on <a href="https://omeka.org/classic/">Omeka Classic</a>, which is at the core of
what is currently offered in this toolkit. Follow the materials in our
toolkit section on <a href="#setting-up-omeka-classic">Setting up Omeka
Classic</a>
to build a site similar to <a href="http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/rally/"><em>“Unite the Right” Rally and Community
Response</em></a>. We’ve
identified
<a href="#omeka-plugins">plugins</a>
and created a <a href="#custom-omeka-theme">custom
theme</a>
specifically for use with Omeka Classic.</p>

<p>Your project needs may align instead with <a href="https://omeka.org/s/">Omeka
S</a>, which offers many of the same options as Omeka
Classic. Instead of plugins, Omeka S provides
<a href="https://omeka.org/s/modules/">modules</a> to extend the functionality of
your site. The <a href="https://omeka.org/s/modules/Collecting/">Collecting</a>
module offers the equivalent to the Contribution plugin for collecting
public contributions through your site. The <a href="https://omeka.org/s/modules/CustomVocab/">Custom
Vocab</a> module is comparable to
the Simple Vocab plugin for providing predetermined vocabulary for any
metadata elements. See the complete <a href="https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/">User
Manual</a> for Omeka S, and the
complete list of <a href="https://omeka.org/s/modules/">modules</a> for that
platform.</p>

<h3 id="file-size-limitations">File Size Limitations</h3>

<p>You’ll want to consider setting a limit on the file size for individual
contributions uploaded through your site’s collection form. These
settings are server specific, and can be set up by your server
administrator when you install Omeka. If you’re using Reclaim Hosting,
or another shared hosting service, you may not be able to change the
file size limitations.</p>

<p>For our digital collecting site, we set the maximum file size for
uploads at 250Mb. This is large enough for short video files taken with
smartphones, which was an item we were interested in collecting.
Creating a limit on file size may seem restrictive, but it is important
for the sustainability of your server, where your files are stored. Your
available server space is determined by your institution or your shared
hosting service (like <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim</a>), so
consider how much total space you have for file storage when determining
size restrictions.</p>

<h3 id="large-files-and-file-sets">Large Files and File Sets</h3>

<p>Currently, the Contribution plugin for Omeka Classic allows for only
individual file uploads, with a maximum file size set by your server
administrator. For our site, we encourage contributors to use the
contribution form to submit their materials, as it provides the simplest
way for us to process the items we receive. However, for files larger
than 250Mb or for large file sets we provide an option for contributing
a URL link for an album or file location (i.e. Dropbox folder, Flickr
album, etc.). When images and video files are uploaded directly through
the contribution form, they’re processed as Omeka items, and easily
managed from the Omeka dashboard. Materials submitted as links have
required significantly more time on our end to include them in the
collection, and has been a major impediment to making more of our
archive public.</p>

<p>Omeka offers the Dropbox plugin, which lets Omeka users batch upload a
large quantity of files at once. It allows you to upload multiple files
directly into a folder on your server that you can then add in the items
admin interface. We have not used this plugin at this time for our site,
but it offers one option for handling large file set submissions.</p>

<h1 id="setting-up-omeka-classic">Setting Up Omeka Classic</h1>

<p>The University of Virginia Library’s Digital Collecting site, <a href="http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/rally/"><em>“Unite
the Right” Rally and Community
Response</em></a> runs on
<a href="https://omeka.org/classic/"><em>Omeka Classic</em></a>.</p>

<p><a href="omeka.org"><em>Omeka</em></a> is a leading open source collections-based web
publishing platform developed by the <a href="https://rrchnm.org/">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History
and New Media</a> and supports a robust open source
developer community. Omeka is standards-based, grounded in a flexible
<a href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Working_with_Dublin_Core/">Dublin Core Metadata
Schema</a>.
Omeka takes a user-centered, access-focused approach to collections,
emphasizing approachable, accessible web design.</p>

<h2 id="technical-specifications">Technical Specifications</h2>

<p>If you are a member of a university or institution with an accessible IT
Department or Digital Content Developers, we recommend reaching out to
individuals in your organization with experience setting up Omeka.</p>

<p>Omeka Classic has the following system requirements: - Linux operating
system - <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> HTTP server (with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">mod_rewrite</code> enabled) - <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> version 5.0 or
greater - <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a> scripting language version 5.3.2
or greater (with mysqli and exif extensions installed) -
<a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> image
manipulation software (for resizing images)</p>

<p>If you lack access to a server that meets Omeka’s basic requirements, or
are looking for a <strong>simpler and less technical set-up process</strong>, we
recommend <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a>, a low-cost
shared web host offering one-click Omeka installation, with a free
domain registration included. Their support staff is easy to reach and
their <a href="https://community.reclaimhosting.com/">Community Forum</a> offers
additional resources.</p>

<h2 id="omeka-classic-plugins">Omeka Classic Plugins</h2>

<p>One of the primary features of a rapid response digital collecting site
is a user-friendly submission form set up to collect photos, videos,
stories, website links, audio and other files from the community. Omeka
Classic offers the <a href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/Contribution/">Contribution
plugin</a>, which
adds a content submission form to your public collecting site.</p>

<p>When using the Contribution plugin, contributors may share and upload
content anonymously, and their information will only be available to
site administrators. All contributions are private by default and
require a site administrator to review and make them public on the Omeka
site.</p>

<p>The plugin can also automatically add a reCAPTCHA box at the bottom of
each form to prevent bots from spamming your website. Contribution
also offers options for users to create guest accounts that make it
easier for one user to submit multiple items.</p>

<p><strong>In addition to the Contribution plugin, there are additional Omeka
Classic plugins that may be useful to your digital collecting site.
See the following page for details on <a href="#omeka-plugins">Omeka Classic
Plugins</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="custom-omeka-theme">Custom Omeka Theme</h2>

<p>This toolkit also offers a custom Omeka theme that you can download for
the styling and content of your public Omeka site. This is not required,
but you may find it useful for getting your collecting site up and
running quickly with minimal technical knowledge. Our theme offers
customizable settings for the appearance and content of your site,
easily accessible from the Omeka admin dashboard, no coding knowledge
needed! For details on installing and customizing our Digital Collecting
Theme for your site, see
<a href="#custom-omeka-theme">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Contribution plugin provides a form to collect stories, images, and
other files from the public and manage those contributions in your Omeka
site as items. Contributors may share and upload content anonymously,
and their information will only be available to site administrators.
Other plugins can be integrated into the Contribution form, such as
Simple Vocab for creating dropdown menu choices, and Geolocation for
inviting users to map their submissions or locations.</p>

<p>Installing and configuring the Contribution plugin requires a few steps.
Please read through the <a href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/Contribution/">Omeka
documentation</a>
carefully.</p>

plugin</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/DublinCoreExtended/">Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Dublin Core Extended provides additional metadata elements that you may
find useful to collect in your Contribution collection form. We used
this plugin specifically for the ‘Spatial Coverage’ element, which along
with the Simple Vocab plugin, allows contributors to submit the location
of their contribution.</p>

</ul>

<p>Simple Vocab is a useful plugin for providing predetermined vocabulary
for any metadata elements. This plugin allows you to create drop-down
menus that replace the usual text box for an element.</p>

<p>We used Simple Vocab to replace the element for “Spatial Coverage” with
a list of locations around Charlottesville relevant to the events. When
a contributor chooses to fill out the ‘Location’ input in the collection
form, they choose from a drop-down list of predetermined terms, set in
the Simple Vocab settings. Once the plugin is installed, you can manage
your custom vocabulary by clicking on the ‘Simple Vocab’ tab on the
left-hand menu in your Omeka dashboard:</p>

</ul>

<p>The Search by Metadata plugin makes it possible for visitors to your
public Omeka site to see a browse page with items that share specific
metadata (i.e., all items with ‘UVA Rotunda’ in the Spatial Coverage
field). This plugin works very well with the Simple Vocab plugin for
controlling metadata vocabulary. See the related <a href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/SearchByMetadata/">Omeka
documentation</a>
for details on configuring this plugin.</p>

<h2 id="additional-plugins">Additional Plugins</h2>

<p>The Geolocation plugin allows you to assign a location to items in your
Omeka site. The locations are displayed on maps on individual items page
and on a browsable map of all geolocated items, that you can add to your
site’s primary navigation. This plugin also allows you to add a map to
your Contribution form, allowing contributors to select locations on a

<h1 id="collecting-materials">Collecting Materials</h1>

<p>We’ve included detailed documentation on how our <a href="http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/rally/">Digital
Collecting</a> site uses
the <a href="https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/Contribution/">Contribution
plugin</a> for Omeka to collect
stories, images, videos, and links from the public.</p>

<p>Please read through the plugin’s <a href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/Contribution/">Installation &amp; Configuration
Guide</a> for full
set-up instructions before getting started.</p>

<p>Published: April 25, 2019</p>

<h2 id="creating-contribution-types">Creating Contribution Types</h2>

<p>After installing the plugin, find the settings for Contribution by
clicking on the “Contributed Items” tab on the left-hand navigation
panel of the Omeka admin dashboard. Here you will see four tabs: Getting
Started, Contribution Types, Submission Settings, and Contributions.</p>

<p>Select “Contribution Types” to manage the types of items you’d like
users to share through the form:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scholarslab/digital-collect-toolkit/master/assets/images/contribution-types.png" alt="Screenshot of Contribution Types
Admin" /></p>

<p>See in the above image that we have included four contribution types for
our site: <em>Story, Photograph, Link,</em> and <em>Video</em>. The type’s <em>Name</em> is
the label that will appear in your site’s Contribution Form:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scholarslab/digital-collect-toolkit/master/assets/images/form-type.png" alt="Screenshot of Contribution Form, Select
Type" /></p>

<p>The <em>Item Type</em> is the type of object associated with your Contribution
Type, and is selected when you add a new contribution type to your form
(see the green button ‘Add a Type’ on the right). These are not visible
to the public, but can help in defining search fields.</p>

<p>Omeka comes with pre-defined item types, found by clicking on the “Item
Types” tab on the left-hand navigation panel of the Omeka admin
dashboard. You can edit and add to this list if needed (see the related
<a href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Item_Types/">Omeka
Documentation</a>). Our
site uses the pre-defined types: <em>Text, Still Image, Hyperlink,</em> and
<em>Moving Image</em>.</p>

<h2 id="contributor-anonymity-settings">Contributor Anonymity Settings</h2>

<p>Under the tab for “Submission Settings” you can set options for
contributor anonymity. Our site allows both Non-Registered Contributions
and Anonymous Contributions:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scholarslab/digital-collect-toolkit/master/assets/images/contrib-settings.png" alt="Screenshot of Contribution Settings
panel" /></p>

<p>It is important to make clear in your Terms of Service that user
anonymity is conditional, and it is likely that under a lawful subpoena or court order, all submissions and associated data may be required to be provided to federal, state, or local law enforcement or other government agencies. See our <a href="#contribution-terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> section for more details.</p>

<p>For further documentation on Contribution Submission Settings and
Contributor anonymity settings, see the related <a href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/Contribution/#submission-settings">Omeka Documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="contribution-terms-of-service">Contribution Terms of Service</h2>

<p>We offer a general Contribution Terms of Service template for others as
a model. <a href="http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/rally/contribution/terms">Our
terms</a>
were written in collaboration with University of Virginia General
Council. We recommend reviewing your terms with relevant parties for
your own collecting site.</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/rally/">Digital
Collecting</a> site uses
a custom Omeka Theme: <a href="https://github.com/scholarslab/cville_rally_theme">Charlottesville Rally
Theme</a>. We developed
this theme specifically for use in digital collecting sites, making it
simple to customize the content and appearance of your public site
directly from your Omeka Dashboard - no coding knowledge required.</p>

<p>Published: April 25, 2019</p>

<h2 id="steps-for-installing-our-custom-theme">Steps for Installing our Custom Theme</h2>

<ol>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Locate your Omeka installation and login to access your site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to your Omeka folder (this should have the same name as
your Omeka install)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open your Omeka folder and locate the ‘/themes’ folder within.</p>
  </li>

these will not appear on your site.</p>

<p>The other two content boxes, <em>Homepage Content Box #3</em> and <em>Homepage

<p>Published: April 25, 2019</p>

<h2 id="managing-users">Managing Users</h2>

<p>Manage users by clicking on the Users tab in the top navigation of your
Omeka admin dashboard. The Users section gives the site Administrator
control over who may access the admin section of the site and what they
can do.</p>

<h3 id="user-levels-and-access">User Levels and Access</h3>

<p>Omeka allows you to give different backend users different levels of
access to your archive. Read through the following list of actions
available to users to determine what works best for your project team
members.</p>

<p>All logged in site Super, Admin, Contributor, and Researcher users can
view non-public content (items, collections, Simple Pages, Exhibits,
etc) on the site.</p>

<h3 id="super-users">Super Users</h3>

<p>Can do anything and everything in Omeka. Supers are the only users with
access to the top navigation tabs for Plugins, Appearance, Users, and
Settings.</p>

<h3 id="admin-users">Admin Users</h3>

<p>Admin users do not have access to the tabs for managing plugins,
appearance, users, or site settings. Admin users can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add, edit, tag, and delete items, both their own and created by
other users.</li>
  <li>Make items, collections, exhibits, and other content public or not
public.</li>
  <li>Make items, collections, exhibits, and other content features or not
featured.</li>
  <li>Add, edit, and delete Item Types.</li>
  <li>Add, edit, and delete files.</li>
  <li>Interact with plugins installed and activated by a SuperUser.</li>
  <li>Add, edit, and delete tags.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contributor-users">Contributor Users</h3>

<p>Contributor users have control over their own content but can only view
content created by others. They cannot make their own content public.
<strong>Contributor Users are different from ‘Guest’ and ‘Contribution
anonymous’, the user types added when using the Contribution and Guest
User plugins. See <a href="#guest-users">below</a> for details on these user
types</strong>. Contributor users can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add, edit, tag, and delete items which they created.</li>
  <li>cannot make their own items public.</li>
  <li>create their own exhibits from items that are public.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="researcher-users">Researcher Users</h3>

<p>Researchers can log in to the admin side of an Omeka site and see the
content, but cannot interact with it in any way. They cannot add, edit,
delete, or tag any items.</p>

<p>For complete documentation on managing users, see the related page in
the Omeka Classic documentation,
<a href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Users/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="guest-users">Guest &amp; ‘Contribution Anonymous’ Users</h3>

<p>When using the Contribution and Guest User plugins, two additional user
types will become available - Guest &amp; ‘Contribution Anonymous’.
Depending on how you configure these two plugins, when users make
submissions through your contribution form, they will potentially have
the option of including their email to set up a ‘Guest’ user account, or
they can choose to make their submission anonymous.</p>

<p>For details on configuring these settings for user contributions, see
the related section in <a href="#contributor-anonymity-settings">Collecting
Materials</a>.</p>

<h2 id="site-security-settings">Site Security Settings</h2>

<p>Access your site’s Security Settings by clicking on the ‘Settings’ tab
in the top navigation of your Omeka admin dashboard. Then select the
‘Security’ tab in the Settings toolbar:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scholarslab/digital-collect-toolkit/master/assets/images/security-settings.png" alt="Screen shot of Security settings

<p>Scroll down to the Captcha section. A captcha is a program that can help
ensure that only actual people, not spammers or robots, are using public
forms on your Omeka site, including the Contribution plugin content
submission form.</p>

<h1 id="tools-for-archiving-social-media">Tools for Archiving Social Media</h1>

<p>This guide presents methods of collecting twitter data using tools built
by <a href="https://www.docnow.io/">DocNow</a>, a collaborative effort between
Shift Design, Inc., the University of Maryland, and the University of
Virginia, with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. We use the
tools developed by DocNow for collecting twitter data because of their
strong commitment to prioritizing ethical practices in collection, use,
and preservation of social media content.</p>

<p>The following documentation is intended to assist in setting up
<a href="https://github.com/DocNow/twarc">Twarc</a>, a DocNow tool for archiving
twitter data. For more information on Twarc or other DocNow tools,
please visit their <a href="https://www.docnow.io/">site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="twarc-for-twitter-data-collection">Twarc for Twitter Data Collection</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/DocNow/twarc">Twarc</a> is a command line tool that
downloads tweets using Twitter’s API. API’s, or application programming
interfaces, are simply ways that different organizations, whether it is
Twitter or the Census bureau, provide more direct access to data. API’s
also oftentimes provide limits to how much data you can gather. Twarc
will handle Twitter API’s <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/rate-limiting">rate
limits</a> for
you.</p>

<p>The following pages provide instructions on installing and using Twarc.
Parts of this guide are subject to change with updates to Twitter’s
developers site, so please use this guide as a general guideline. For
troubleshooting with Twarc, please contact the developers of
<a href="https://www.docnow.io/">DocNow</a>, and join in conversation with the
DocNow community of scholars, students, and archivists.</p>

<p>To get started you will need a <a href="#setting-up-your-twitter-account-for-collecting">twitter account to register a twitter
application</a>.
Twarc also requires <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>.</p>

updates to Twitter. If the following steps and screenshots do not match
precisely, please use this as a general guide, or contact
<a href="https://www.docnow.io/">DocNow</a>.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you do not have a twitter account, create one at
<a href="https://twitter.com/">twitter.com</a>. A twitter account is required
for access to twitter data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Log into you twitter account to set-up and and authorize a twitter
application. A Twitter application will let you download twitter
data using Python.</p>

    <p>Create an app at
<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps">developer.twitter.com/en/apps</a></p>

    <p>Following the above link should bring you to this page:</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on ‘Create an App’</p>

    <p>You may be prompted to create a Twitter developer account. Select
‘Apply’ and continue:</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-a-twitter-developer-account">Setting up a Twitter Developer Account</h3>

<p>If you already have a developer account set up, skip to <a href="#creating-a-twitter-app">Creating a
Twitter App</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Select a user profile to associate with the developer account, and
select ‘Continue’.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the ‘Account details’ section, select your request for access for
either your organization or for personal use.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Selecting “for my own personal use” offers the simplest
and quickest method of setting up a developer account. If you are
following this guide for research or teaching purposes, an
individual, personal account is suggested. Twitter users can only
have a single development account, and cannot change account types.
An ‘Organization’ account differs in that it allows for additional
twitter users to share access on a single dev account, however, this
is mainly geared toward commercial use and is intended for
development for premium APIs ($), and is outside the scope of this
guide. For more, see <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/faq.html">Twitter’s
FAQ</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you select “for my own personal use,” you will be prompted to
fill in an Account Name and to select your Primary Country of
Operation. Both are required.</li>
      <li>If you select “for my organization,” you are required to fill
out the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Organization Name (the name of your account)</li>
          <li>Legal Entity Name (may be the same as Organization Name)</li>
          <li>Organization Twitter @username</li>
          <li>Organization Primary Country of Operation</li>
          <li>Customer Location (select ‘Not Applicable(we do not have

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the next section on ‘Use Case Details’, answer several questions
about your project and why you are building an app to gather twitter
data. You can provide answers similar to the ones below if relevant
to your project. <strong>Most importantly note that this is for academic
purposes and that you will not be Tweeting, Retweeting, or liking
content.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-collect-tweets">Why Collect Tweets?</h2>

<p>Twitter is undeniably a part of the cultural landscape of the modern
world, and its content represents a new form of the historical record,
one that archivists around the world are actively working to preserve.</p>

<p>Particularly relevant to researchers interested in exploring popular
movements, the dynamics of fast-moving socio-political events, and the
digital footprint of contemporary culture, Twitter archiving is becoming
increasingly more prominent in the catalog of activities taking place
under the umbrella of digital curation.</p>

<p>Like other digital archiving efforts, the collection and curation of
Twitter data does involve some unique challenges, not least of which is
the functionally infinite size of the dataset. For this reason, a large
part of collecting, archiving, and providing access to Twitter data
involves deciding what to collect and why. Any Twitter archive will
reflect the intention of its collector - from the tools used to gather
the data to the kind of search used to collect, Twitter archives are
always a directed slice of the ever-expanding pie that is social media.</p>

<h2 id="data-collection-process">Data Collection Process</h2>

<p>The University of Virginia currently archives collections of Twitter
data using <a href="https://github.com/DocNow/twarc">Twarc</a>, a command line tool
and Python library developed as part of the <a href="https://www.docnow.io/">Documenting the
Now</a> project. Twarc provides several different
methods for collecting Twitter data, which are outlined below. Note that
each collection method has a distinct goal in mind, and will have
slightly different outputs depending on how the data is collected. It is
important to note the kind of collection process used to generate a
specific Twitter archive - the table below outlines some of these
variations and the effects on their output. The type of collection
method should be noted in the description of each Twitter archive, as
well as the date and size of the collection, along with the dates of
collection and dataset size.</p>

<h2 id="common-twarc-collection-methods-used-in-archiving">Common Twarc Collection Methods Used in Archiving</h2>

<p><em>For more detailed usage documentation, see the following page on <a href="#twarc-commands">Twarc
Commands</a>.</em>
<em>You can also <a href="#start-collecting-twarc-command-basics">skip ahead to the beginner’s tutorial on using
Twarc</a>.</em> ### Search Collects
pre-existing tweets from up to seven days ago that match the given
query. This method allows you to gather tweets that are already
published, but will not collect any tweets that have been made private
or deleted by the time you run your search. ### Filter Initiates a
collection process that will gather tweets matching the given query as
they are published. This process does not gather tweets that were
already published by the time the filter is initialized, but will ensure
a high-fidelity capture of all material between the start and end times
of the filter. Unlike a search, it is also not limited to a single week,
and can be run as long as you want.\
### Sample This method returns a random sampling of tweets. ###
Timeline The timeline command will collect the most recent tweets from a
single user. Like search, it can only go back seven days.</p>

<h3 id="side-by-side-search-vs-filter">Side by Side: Search vs Filter</h3>

<p>The following example illustrates some of the differences between using
search and filter methods with the same arguments and output. In this
case, we are looking for all tweets containing the keyword
“charlottesville”.</p>

<p>|| Search | Filter | || ———– | ———– | |<strong>Twarc
Command</strong>| twarc search [charlottesville]{style=”color:blue”} &gt;
[charlottesville-tweets]{style=”color:blue”}.jsonl | twarc filter
[charlottesville]{style=”color:blue”} &gt;
[charlottesville-tweets]{style=”color:blue”}.jsonl | |<strong>Description</strong>
| Searches all existing tweets from the present to seven days earlier
(this time limit is set by Twitter).| Initiates a collection process
that will gather tweets, as they are published, until you tell it to
stop.| |<strong>Output</strong> | Returns results as a JSONL file, where each JSON
object = a single tweet.| Returns results as a JSONL file, where each
JSON object = a single tweet.| |<strong>Notes</strong> | Captures all relevant
tweets up to a week prior to the search date, but will not capture any
tweets that have been either privatized or deleted by the time the
search is run.| A higher-fidelity collecting method that archives
tweets in real time. Twarc filtering requires a dedicated machine that
stays on for the duration of the process.|</p>

<p><em>The [blue text]{style=”color:blue”} in the twarc command field is
modifiable: this is where you tell Twarc what you want to search for,
and where you want to name the JSONL file that will contain the
results.</em></p>

<h2 id="dehydrated-and-rehydrated-data-sets">Dehydrated and Rehydrated Data Sets</h2>

<p>Twitter API’s <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy#6._Be_a_Good_Partner_to_Twitter">Terms of
Service</a>
does not allow for making large amounts of raw Twitter data available on
the Web. The fully-hydrated Twitter data you collect using Twarc can be
used for research and archived for local use, but cannot be shared
publicly. However, Twitter does allow files of tweet identifiers to be
publicly shared. This is useful for when you would like to make a
dataset of tweets available, for example, in <a href="https://www.docnow.io/catalog/">DocNow’s Tweet
Catalogue</a>. This is referred to as a
“dehydrated” data set - each tweet is reduced to its unique ID number,
and a list of these IDs is saved as a text document. You can <a href="#dehydrate-your-dataset">use Twarc
to dehydrate your data set</a>.</p>

<p>A dehydrated data set can be <a href="#rehydrate-a-dataset">“rehydrated” using
Twarc</a> or another program of your choice - Twitter
will take each ID and search the current Twitterverse for a
corresponding tweet. If it locates a tweet that matches the ID, it will
return the original JSON code for that tweet. This process is called
“rehydration”, and will return a JSON file containing the data for every
tweet that it was able to locate. It’s important to note that any tweet
rehydrator can only check for tweets that are currently live - they
cannot find tweets that have been deleted or made private since the
original collection event.</p>

<h2 id="start-collecting-twarc-command-basics">Start Collecting: Twarc Command Basics</h2>

<h3 id="collecting-tweets">Collecting Tweets</h3>

<p>Let’s start collecting tweets! This introductory lesson will use Twarc’s
search command to return tweets containing ‘BlackLivesMatter’ occurring
within the past 7 days. For further instructions on using other
commands, see the following page on <a href="#twarc-commands">Twarc
Commands</a>.
This lesson assumes some basic familiarity with the command line
(Terminal for Mac users, PowerShell for Windows users).</p>

  <li>
    <p>Create a new folder on your desktop titled
‘BlackLivesMatter_Tweets’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open Terminal (for Mac) or PowerShell (for Windows)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change directories to navigate into the ‘BlackLivesMatter_Tweets’
folder by typing into the command line <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> followed by the path of
your folder:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> cd desktop/BlackLivesMatter_Tweets
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Hit ‘return’ to complete the command.</p>

    <p>You can also navigate to your folder by typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> followed by a
space, then drag your folder into the Terminal or PowerShell window.
Hit return to complete the command</p>

    <p>To check if you are in the correct place, use the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> to
display the path of your current directory. It should end with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/BlackLivesMatter_Tweets</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that you are in the right directory, enter the following command
to start collecting tweets:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> twarc search blacklivesmatter &gt; blacklivesmatter_tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><em>Tip: You can copy and paste these commands into Terminal or
PowerShell to avoid errors</em></p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Your collection may take some time to return all Tweets.
You can tell when the process is complete when it returns to the
shell ($) (or PowerShell (PS) ) prompt:</p>

    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scholarslab/digital-collect-toolkit/master/assets/images/terminal-3.png" alt="Screen shot of terminal twarc
search" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the prompt is running, check to make sure your command was
successful by clicking on your ‘BlackLivesMatter_Tweets’ folder.
Inside you should see your ‘blacklivesmatter_tweets.jsonl’ file and
a ‘twarc.log’ file.</p>

    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scholarslab/digital-collect-toolkit/master/assets/images/tweet-data-folder.png" alt="Screen shot of 'BlackLivesMatter_Tweets' folder
contents" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of this tutorial, you can cut the search short.
After entering the initial search command, wait 5 minutes and then
enter Ctrl + C to stop the search.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you wanted to collect the full set of tweets, you would
wait until the process was finished. You can tell when a process is
complete when it returns to the shell ($) prompt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You’re done! Your tweets are in JSON format in your
‘blacklivesmatter_tweets.jsonl’ file.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="dehydrate-your-dataset">Dehydrate your Dataset</h3>

<p>Each Tweet in your dataset has a unique identifier. Twarc’s dehydrate
command will generate a list of tweet ids from a file of tweets. This
lesson will show you how to dehydrate your
‘blacklivesmatter_tweets.jsonl’ file so that you can share your dataset
while keeping to Twitter API’s <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy#6._Be_a_Good_Partner_to_Twitter">Terms of
Service</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate into you ‘BlackLivesMatter_Tweets’ folder using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code>
command, or if you are already there, check you directory location
using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> to list all files in the directory. You
should see the files ‘blacklivesmatter_tweets.jsonl’ and
‘twarc.log’. It will look something like this:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> 'your-computer-name':BlackLivesMatter_Tweets 'your-user-name'$ ls
 blacklivesmatter_tweets.jsonl   twarc.log
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To dehydrate your tweets, enter the following command:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> twarc dehydrate blacklivesmatter_tweets.jsonl &gt; blacklivesmatter_tweet_ids.txt 
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should now have a text file containing the unique tweet ids of
all tweets in your dataset. Your tweet ids are located in your
‘BlackLivesMatter_Tweets’ folder in the
‘blacklivesmatter_tweet_ids.txt’ file.</p>

    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scholarslab/digital-collect-toolkit/master/assets/images/tweet-data-folder-2.png" alt="Screen shot of 'BlackLivesMatter_Tweets' folder
contents" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the blacklivesmatter_tweet_ids.txt file to see the list of
unique tweet ids:</p>

    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scholarslab/digital-collect-toolkit/master/assets/images/txt-file-ids.png" alt="Screen shot of txt file
contents" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rehydrate-a-dataset">Rehydrate a Dataset</h3>

<p>Twarc’s hydrate command will read your file of unique identifiers and
write out the tweet JSON for them using Twitter’s <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index">status/lookup
API</a>. This is
useful if you have a set of Twitter ids from another institution and
would like to view the full dataset. <a href="https://www.docnow.io/">Documenting the
Now</a> has a collection of Tweet ids that you can
explore and rehydrate <a href="https://www.docnow.io/catalog/">here</a>, but for
this tutorial we will use the ‘blacklivesmatter_tweet_ids.txt’ file
you created when you dehydrated your dataset.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate into you ‘BlackLivesMatter_Tweets’ folder using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code>
command, or if you are already there, check you directory location
using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rehydrate your dataset by entering the following command:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> twarc hydrate blacklivesmatter_tweet_ids.txt &gt; blacklivesmatter_tweets_hydrated.jsonl 
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You now have your tweets in JSON format ready to go in your
‘BlackLivesMatter_Tweets’ folder. Check your folder to confirm your
.jsonl file is there.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now you’re ready for more complex Twarc commands that will allow you to
create a collection to fit your research needs: <a href="#twarc-commands">Twarc
Commands</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="twarc-commands">Twarc Commands</h1>

<p>After you’ve become familiar with the basics of using Twarc to perform a
search command to collect Twitter data, dehydrate an existing dataset,
and hydrate a list of unique Tweet ids, you can move on to more complex
commands to tailor your search to your research needs.</p>

<p>Below you will find a list of commands that will allow you to create a
more targeted collection. This documentation is from the <a href="https://github.com/DocNow/twarc#usage">Twarc Usage
Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Published: April 25, 2019</p>

<h2 id="search">Search</h2>

<p>This uses Twitter’s
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/search/tweets">search/tweets</a>
to download <em>pre-existing</em> tweets matching a given query.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc search blacklivesmatter &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s important to note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">search</code> will return tweets that are found
within a 7 day window that Twitter’s search API imposes. If this seems
like a small window, it is, but you may be interested in collecting
tweets as they happen using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">filter</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">sample</code> commands below.</p>

<p>The best way to get familiar with Twitter’s search syntax is to
experiment with <a href="https://twitter.com/search-advanced">Twitter’s Advanced
Search</a> and copy and pasting the
resulting query from the search box. For example here is a more
complicated query that searches for tweets containing either the
#blacklivesmatter or #blm hashtags that were sent to deray.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc search '#blacklivesmatter OR #blm to:deray' &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Twitter attempts to code the language of a tweet, and you can limit your
search to a particular language if you want:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc search '#blacklivesmatter' --lang fr &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also search for tweets with a given location, for example tweets
mentioning <em>blacklivesmatter</em> that are 1 mile from the center of
Ferguson, Missouri:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc search blacklivesmatter --geocode 38.7442,-90.3054,1mi &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If a search query isn’t supplied when using <code class="highlighter-rouge">--geocode</code> you will get all
tweets relevant for that location and radius:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc search --geocode 38.7442,-90.3054,1mi &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="filter">Filter</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">filter</code> command will use Twitter’s
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/reference/post/statuses/filter">statuses/filter</a>
API to collect tweets as they happen.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc filter blacklivesmatter,blm &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Please note that the syntax for the Twitter’s track queries is slightly
different than what queries in their search API. So please consult the
documentation on how best to express the filter option you are using.</p>

<p>Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">follow</code> command line argument if you would like to collect
tweets from a given user id as they happen. This includes retweets. For
example this will collect tweets and retweets from CNN:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc filter --follow 759251 &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also collect tweets using a bounding box. Note: the leading dash
needs to be escaped in the bounding box or else it will be interpreted
as a command line argument!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc filter --locations "\-74,40,-73,41" &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you combine options they are OR’ed together. For example this will
collect tweets that use the blacklivesmatter or blm hashtags and also
tweets from user CNN:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc filter blacklivesmatter,blm --follow 759251 &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="sample">Sample</h2>

<p>Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sample</code> command to listen to Twitter’s
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/reference/get/statuses/sample">statuses/sample</a>
API for a “random” sample of recent public statuses.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc sample &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="dehydrate">Dehydrate</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">dehydrate</code> command generates an id list from a file of tweets:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc dehydrate tweets.jsonl &gt; tweet-ids.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="hydrate">Hydrate</h2>

<p>Twarc’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">hydrate</code> command will read a file of tweet identifiers and
write out the tweet JSON for them using Twitter’s
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/lookup">status/lookup</a>
API.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc hydrate ids.txt &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Twitter API’s <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/policy#6._Be_a_Good_Partner_to_Twitter">Terms of
Service</a>
discourage people from making large amounts of raw Twitter data
available on the Web. The data can be used for research and archived for
local use, but not shared with the world. Twitter does allow files of
tweet identifiers to be shared, which can be useful when you would like
to make a dataset of tweets available. You can then use Twitter’s API to
<em>hydrate</em> the data, or to retrieve the full JSON for each identifier.
This is particularly important for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">verification</a> of social
media research.</p>

<h2 id="users">Users</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">users</code> command will return User metadata for the given screen
names.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc users deray,Nettaaaaaaaa &gt; users.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also give it user ids:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc users 1232134,1413213 &gt; users.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want you can also use a file of user ids, which can be useful if
you are using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">followers</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">friends</code> commands below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc users ids.txt &gt; users.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="followers">Followers</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">followers</code> command will use Twitter’s <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/followers/ids">follower id
API</a> to
collect the follower user ids for exactly one user screen name per
request as specified as an argument:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc followers deray &gt; follower_ids.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result will include exactly one user id per line. The response order
is reverse chronological, or most recent followers first.</p>

<h2 id="friends">Friends</h2>

<p>Like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">followers</code> command, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">friends</code> command will use Twitter’s
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids">friend id API</a>
to collect the friend user ids for exactly one user screen name per
request as specified as an argument:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc friends deray &gt; friend_ids.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="trends">Trends</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">trends</code> command lets you retrieve information from Twitter’s API
about trending hashtags. You need to supply a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/">Where On
Earth</a> identifier (<code class="highlighter-rouge">woeid</code>)
to indicate what trends you are interested in. For example here’s how
you can get the current trends for St Louis:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc trends 2486982
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using a <code class="highlighter-rouge">woeid</code> of 1 will return trends for the entire planet:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc trends 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you aren’t sure what to use as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">woeid</code> just omit it and you will
get a list of all the places for which Twitter tracks trends:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc trends
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have a geo-location you can use it instead of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">woedid</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc trends 39.9062,-79.4679
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Behind the scenes twarc will lookup the location using Twitter’s
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/trends/closest">trends/closest</a>
API to find the nearest <code class="highlighter-rouge">woeid</code>.</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">timeline</code> command will use Twitter’s <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline">user timeline
API</a>
to collect the most recent tweets posted by the user indicated by
screen_name.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc timeline deray &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also look up users using a user id:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc timeline 12345 &gt; tweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="retweets">Retweets</h2>

<p>You can get retweets for a given tweet id like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc retweets 824077910927691778 &gt; retweets.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="replies">Replies</h2>

<p>Unfortunately Twitter’s API does not currently support getting replies
to a tweet. So twarc approximates it by using the search API. Since the
search API does not support getting tweets older than a week twarc can
only get all the replies to a tweet that have been sent in the last
week.</p>

<p>If you want to get the replies to a given tweet you can:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc replies 824077910927691778 &gt; replies.jsonl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--recursive</code> option will also fetch replies to the replies as
well as quotes. This can take a long time to complete for a large thread
because of rate limiting by the search API.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc replies 824077910927691778 --recursive
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>

<p>To get the users that are on a list you can use the list URL with the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">listmembers</code> command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>twarc listmembers https://twitter.com/edsu/lists/bots
</code></pre></div></div>

<h1 id="about-the-toolkit">About the Toolkit</h1>

<p>As the events of Friday August 11th and Saturday August 12th, 2017 in
Charlottesville unfolded, Library staff at the University of Virginia
actively watched the news and began capturing information from websites
and social media. When Library administration met the following Tuesday
morning, we were asked if we could create a site that allowed community
members to contribute their photos and videos online. While the UVA
Library had some experience documenting and collecting digital content
after a major news event, this was the first time we attempted to create
a collecting site so quickly after the events occurred.</p>

<p>We consulted with other institutions who had created similar sites, and
built on their previous work. We set up workflows to ensure that no
malware or viruses were upload in the process. It took us a little over
three weeks to launch our online collecting tool, far longer than we had
initially hoped. The lessons learned from the site launch of the
University of Virginia Library’s Digital Collecting site, <a href="http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/rally/"><em>“Unite the
Right” Rally and Community
Response</em></a> has led to
the development of this toolkit to help future rapid response collecting
efforts for ourselves and others.</p>
