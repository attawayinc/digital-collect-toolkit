- Simple Vocab is a useful plugin for providing predetermined vocabulary for any metadata elements. This plugin allows you to create drop-down menus that replace the usual text box for an element. 

We used Simple Vocab to replace the element for "Spatial Coverage" with a list of locations around Charlottesville relevant to the events:
