# Custom Omeka Theme

Our [Digital Collecting](http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/rally/) site uses a custom Omeka Theme: [Charlotesville Rally Theme](https://github.com/scholarslab/cville_rally_theme).
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
## Steps for Installing Our Custom Theme

1. Download and unzip our [custom theme from Github](https://github.com/scholarslab/cville_rally_theme). Download the .zip file to your desktop for easy retrieval. 

2. Locate your Omeka installation and login to access your site.

3. Navigate to your Omeka folder (this should have the same name as your Omeka install)

4. Open your Omeka folder and locate the '/themes' folder within.

5. Copy or move the unzipped 'cville_rally_theme' folder from your desktop (or from where you saved this folder) and place it withing the 'omeka/themes' folder located in step #4.

6. Log in to your Omeka admin panel (found at the url: 'your-site-url/admin'), and click on the 'Appearance' option in the top naviation bar.

7. The custom theme should now be installed and visible (see screenshot below). If not, double-check that the folder is in the right location ('/themes') and that the folder name for the theme does not start with 'theme-'.
