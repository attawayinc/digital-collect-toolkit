- UNLV Libraries' [Twitter Data Tutorial Series](https://www.library.unlv.edu/whats_new_in_special_collections/2019/04/new-digital-collections-1-october-twitter-data-tutorial){:target="_blank"}, which features ten tutorials that take you step-by-step through the design, collection, and documentation process of curating a collection of Twitter data, as well as tutorials on tools for data analysis. This tutorial series focuses on using [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc){:target="_blank"} for twitter data collection.

## Hydrator

[Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator){:target="_blank"} is a downloadable app for your computer  developed by [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/){:target="_blank"} for hydrating Twitter ID datasets. Hydrator does not require a Twitter developer account or registered app, and requires no coding knowledge. It streamlines the process of linking your Twitter account, hydrating tweet ID lists, and exporting the raw JSON data into csv for easy access to the dataset.  

This tool is great for researchers who want to do a quick check of the contents of a dataset in Excel - the csv export function in the Hydrator makes it easy to build a spreadsheet of tweets.
