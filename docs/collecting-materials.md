# Collecting Materials
{: .no_toc }

We've included detailed documentation on how our [Digital Collecting](http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/rally/) site uses the [Contribution plugin](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/Contribution/) to collect stories, images, videos, and links from the public. 
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
Please read through the [Installation & Configuration Guide](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/Contribution/) for full set-up instructions before getting started.

## Creating Contribution Types

After installing the plugin, find the settings for Contribution by clicking on the "Contributed Items" tab on the left-hand navigation panel of the Omeka admin dashboard. Here you will see four tabs: Getting Started, Contribution Types, Submission Settings, and Contributions. 

Select "Contribution Types" to manage the types of items you'd like users to share through the form:

See in the above image that we have included four contribution types for our site: _Story, Photograph, Link,_ and _Video_. The type's _Name_ is the label that will appear in your site's Contribution Form:

The _Item Type_ is the type of object associated with your Contribution Type, and is selected when you add a new contribution type to your form (see the green button 'Add a Type' on the right). These are not visible to the public, but can help in defining search fields. 

Omeka comes with pre-defined item types, found by clicking on the "Item Types" tab on the left-hand navigation panel of the Omeka admin dashboard. You can edit and add to this list if needed (see the related [Omeka Documentation](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Item_Types/)). Our site uses the pre-defined types: _Text, Still Image, Hyperlink,_ and _Moving Image_.

## Contributor Anonymity Settings

Under the tab for "Submission Settings" you can set options for contributor anonymity. Our site allows both Non-Registered Contributions and Anonymous Contributions:

It is important to make clear in your Terms of Service that user anonymity is conditional, and it is likely that all submissions and associated data may be provided to federal, state, or local law enforcement or other government agencies pursuant to a lawful subpoena or court order. See our [Terms of Service](#terms-of-service) section for more details. 

For further documentation on Contributution Submission Settings and Contributor anonymity settings, see the related [Omeka Documentation](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/Contribution/#submission-settings).

## Contribution Terms of Service

We offer our Contribution Terms of Service for others as a model. Our terms were written in collaboration with the University of Virgina Library's Legal Issues Librarian. You are welcome to use our text, although we recommend reviewing with relevant parties for your own collecting site. 

>**Contribution Terms of Service:**

>You are being asked to contribute your recollections, photographic images, video, and/or other media to the University of Virginia (UVA), which is developing a permanent digital record of the events surrounding the Unite the Right rally and counter protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.  You represent and warrant that the material you submit was  created by you and was not copied from or based, in whole or in part, upon any other photographic, literary, or other material.
{: .fs-4 .fw-300 }
>Your participation in this project will allow the general public, as well as future University students and historians, to gain a greater understanding of these events and the response to them. You must be 18 years of age or older to submit material to us. Your submission of material constitutes your permission for, and consent to, its dissemination and use in connection with the research and teaching mission of the University of Virginia in all media in perpetuity.
{: .fs-4 .fw-300 }
>If you indicate on the form that your submission is “public,” your material may be published on the web (with or without your name, depending on what you have indicated) as part of the Library’s digital collections or exhibits. Otherwise, your response will only be available to Library-approved researchers. Submitted material must not violate any confidentiality, privacy, security or other laws. Please be aware that all submissions and any information associated with the submissions (email address, descriptive information, etc.) may be provided to federal, state, or local law enforcement or other government agencies pursuant to a lawful subpoena or court order. We reserve the right to discard or mark private any submission that UVA Library staff identify as offensive or irrelevant, or for any other reason within their professional judgment.

In additon, our Digital Collecting site's [Terms of Service](http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/rally/contribution/terms) includes a Summary of Terms to help contributors quickly read and understand the main points of the full terms, in simpler language. It is important to note that this summary does not replace the full terms, and submissions are governed by the full terms of use.

>**Summary of Terms***

> - You must be at least 18 years old.
> - Submitted material must be owned and/or created by you.
> - You have the option of making your contribution public or private. If public, your content may be published as part of the Library’s digital collections (with or without your name displayed, depending on what you have indicated).
> - All submissions will be available to Library-approved researchers and can be used by the Library from now on in support of its teaching and research mission.
> - Your submission must not violate any laws. If we receive a lawful subpoena or court order, we may be required to turn over any submissions and related information (email address, descriptive information, etc.).
